Technical (Negative Prompt): [Elements to avoid - subtitles, captions, watermarks, text overlays, unwanted objects, poor quality, artifacts]
```

### **Quality Hierarchy**

```
ü•á ADVANCED      = All 7 components + advanced techniques + meta prompt automation
ü•à PROFESSIONAL  = 6-7 components with detailed descriptions + some automation
ü•â INTERMEDIATE  = 4-6 components with basic details + minimal automation
‚ö†Ô∏è  BASIC        = 1-3 components (limited results, no automation)
```

---

## üé≠ **CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK**

### **Character Consistency Template**

Meta prompts must include this comprehensive character framework:

```
Character Template: [NAME], a [AGE] [ETHNICITY] [GENDER] with [SPECIFIC_HAIR_DETAILS], [EYE_COLOR] eyes, [DISTINCTIVE_FACIAL_FEATURES], [BUILD_DESCRIPTION], wearing [DETAILED_CLOTHING_DESCRIPTION], with [POSTURE_AND_MANNERISMS], [EMOTIONAL_BASELINE], [DISTINCTIVE_ACCESSORIES], [VOICE_CHARACTERISTICS]
```

### **Physical Attribute Checklist**

‚úÖ **Required Elements (15+ attributes):**
- Age and age range appearance
- Ethnicity and cultural background
- Gender presentation
- Hair: color, style, length, texture
- Eyes: color, shape, expression
- Facial features: symmetry, distinctive characteristics
- Build: height, weight, body type
- Clothing: style, color, fit, material, accessories
- Posture: stance, movement patterns, gestures
- Mannerisms: habits, expressions, behavioral traits
- Emotional state: baseline mood, typical expressions
- Voice: tone, accent, speech patterns
- Distinctive features: scars, tattoos, jewelry
- Professional attributes: expertise indicators
- Personality indicators: confidence, approachability

### **Character Consistency Rules**

1. **Identical Descriptions**: Use exact same wording across all prompts
2. **Physical Continuity**: Maintain all visual characteristics
3. **Behavioral Consistency**: Keep personality traits and mannerisms
4. **Voice Matching**: Preserve speech patterns and delivery style
5. **Wardrobe Continuity**: Consistent clothing and accessories

## üé¨ **CINEMATOGRAPHY INTEGRATION**

### **Camera Movement Mastery**

Meta prompts must include this comprehensive camera library:

#### **Static Shots**
- `static shot`, `fixed camera`, `locked-off shot`
- **Use Case**: Establishing shots, dialogue scenes, detail focus

#### **Dynamic Movements**
- `dolly in/out` - Emotional impact and intimacy control
- `pan left/right` - Scene revelation and information disclosure
- `tilt up/down` - Perspective shifts and scale emphasis
- `tracking shot` - Subject following and spatial awareness
- `crane shot` - Dramatic reveals and environmental context
- `handheld` - Authenticity, energy, documentary feel

### **Camera Position Integration**

> [!TIP]
> **Key Technique**: Veo 3 requires explicit camera positioning using the "(thats where the camera is)" syntax for optimal results.
>
> For detailed camera positioning techniques and examples, see [Advanced Techniques](#-advanced-techniques) section.

### **Shot Composition Framework**

```
Shot Types for Meta Prompts:
- Extreme Wide Shot (EWS): Environmental context and scale

## üî• **ADVANCED TECHNIQUES**

### **Essential Camera Positioning**

> [!TIP]
> **Key Technique**: Always include `"(thats where the camera is)"` when specifying camera position.
>
> **Why This Works**: Veo 3 requires explicit camera positioning rather than generic viewpoint terms. This phrase triggers camera-aware processing and significantly improves generation success rates.

**Expert Examples**:
```
"Close-up shot with camera positioned at counter level (thats where the camera is) as the brand ambassador demonstrates the product"

"Handheld camera held at chest height (thats where the camera is) tracking the subject as they showcase the lifestyle benefits"
```

### **Effective Dialogue Techniques**

**Recommended Dialogue Syntax** (Community-Verified):
```
‚úÖ WORKS - Colon Format (Prevents Subtitles):
"The brand ambassador looks directly at camera and says: 'This product changed my daily routine completely.' Her voice carries genuine enthusiasm."

‚ùå FAILS - Quote Format (Causes Subtitles):
"The brand ambassador says 'This product changed my routine'" (Avoid this format)
```

**Dialogue Length Optimization**:
- **Perfect Length**: 8-second rule (12-15 words, 20-25 syllables)
- **Character-Specific**: Always specify who speaks when
- **Tone Specification**: Include emotional delivery style

---

## üéÆ **ADVANCED MOVEMENT & PHYSICS CONTROL**

**Precision Movement Keywords**: Control exactly how subjects move and behave.

### **Movement Quality Specifications**

```
"natural movement" - Default, realistic human motion
"energetic movement" - Dynamic, high-energy actions
"slow and deliberate movement" - Thoughtful, careful actions
"graceful movement" - Smooth, flowing motion
"confident movement" - Assured, purposeful actions
"fluid movement" - Seamless, continuous motion
```

### **Physics-Aware Prompting**

**Advanced Technique**: Include physics considerations for realistic results

**Physics Keywords**:
```
"realistic physics governing all actions"
"natural fluid dynamics"
"authentic momentum conservation"
"proper weight and balance"
"realistic material behavior"
```

---

## ü§≥ **SELFIE VIDEO TECHNIQUES**

**Effective Approach**: Specific phrases consistently generate authentic selfie behavior in Veo 3.

### **Recommended Selfie Formula**

**Core Structure**:
```
"A selfie video of [CHARACTER]..."
+ "holds the camera at arm's length"
+ "His/her [body part] arm is clearly visible in the frame"
+ "occasionally looking into the camera before [ACTION]"
+ "The image is slightly grainy, looks very film-like"
```

### **Comprehensive Selfie Template**

```
A selfie video of a [CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION] exploring [LOCATION]. [He/She] is wearing [CLOTHING] and has [EMOTION] in [his/her] eyes. [LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION]. [He/She] is [ACTIVITY] while talking, occasionally looking into the camera before [SPECIFIC_ACTION]. The image is slightly grainy, looks very film-like. [He/She] speaks in a [ACCENT] and says: "[DIALOGUE_8_SECONDS_MAX]" [He/She] ends with [GESTURE].
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING & OPTIMIZATION**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Unnatural Movement or Behavior**

**Problem**: Characters move unnaturally or perform unrealistic actions

**Solutions**:
```
‚úÖ Add "natural movement" to prompt
‚úÖ Include "realistic physics governing all actions"
‚úÖ Specify "authentic human behavior patterns"
‚úÖ Use "fluid, lifelike motion" for smoother results
```

**Problem**: Wrong background sounds, unwanted music, or audio hallucinations

**Solutions**:
```
‚úÖ Always specify expected background audio environment
‚úÖ Use "Audio: [specific environmental sounds]" format
‚úÖ Include "no unwanted background music" in negative prompts
‚úÖ Specify "professional audio quality" for clean results
```

#### **Character Consistency Problems**

**Problem**: Character appearance changes between generations

**Solutions**:
```
‚úÖ Create detailed character reference templates
‚úÖ Use exact same character description wording
‚úÖ Include specific physical details consistently
